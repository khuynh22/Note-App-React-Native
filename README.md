### Why React Native
6 main reason why me using React Native for make a mobile app :
<ul>
    <li>It's got iOS and Android covered </li>
    <li>Reusable components allow hybrid apps to render natively</li>
    <li>Apply React Native UI component to an existing app's code-without any rewriting at all</li>
    <li>It’s one of the top mobile JavaScript frameworks among developers—and growing</li>
    <li>React Native is all about the UI</li>
    <li>Native app development is much more efficient</li>
</ul>
